- make it all responsive mobile first
	- popup from click on marker is just a modal sliding in from bottom, google maps style. When click on it it then display modal taking full screen

- Titles are serif (Playfair display from google font ?) (use typography.js) -> https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/custom-fonts-in-gatsby/ ; https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/typography-js/

- Links are buttons from the map page
	- create a logo for "Fontane di Roma"
	- links for logo + to "border less border line" (so must also move the zooming buttons somewhere else)
	- write content (text) for contact & about pages/modal

IN THE FUTURE
- show user's location (button to trigger the functionality)
- modal is displayed with transition/animation
- offer small panel for list/favorites/new stories/unread
