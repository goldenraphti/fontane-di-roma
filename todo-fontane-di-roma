- Links are buttons from the map page
	- create a logo for "Fontane di Roma"
	- links for logo + to "border less border line" (so must also move the zooming buttons somewhere else)
	- write content (text) for contact & about pages/modal

- change buttom icon to an arrow until draggable, an dthen change back to google-map style horizontal gray line
- mobile bottom panel should be draggable by touch (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable)
- on landscape & table, fix style panel. Maybe when ladnscape, no matter if mobile && tablet, do sidePanel instead of bottom 

what should be done for panel on tablet, bottom or side panel ? (when portrait / landscape ?)

IN THE FUTURE
- show user's location (button to trigger the functionality)
- modal is displayed with transition/animation
- offer small panel for list/favorites/new stories/unread
