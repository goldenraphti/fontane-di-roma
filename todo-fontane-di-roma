- when user clicks the pin, it first triggers a small tool-tip, which displays the photo in small + title && excerpt of the story + link to click to "see the full story", which triggers the modal/panel with image & full story
	- it should close the popup too when ser clicks it
	- eventually reorganize poop up text with image

- make it all responsive mobile first

- Links are buttons from the map page

- links for logo + to "border less border line" (so must also move the zooming buttons somewhere else)

IN THE FUTURE
- show user's location (button to trigger the functionality)
- modal is displayed with transition/animation
- offer sall panel for list/favorites/new stories/unread
